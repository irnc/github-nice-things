# Two way links between issues and pull requests

Instead of commenting on some issue with `Look at [this issue](https://github.com/irnc/github-nice-things/issues/1)` write just `Look at issue #1.` GitHub would automatically add link to `#1` part of a text. And as a bonus point, it would create a back link from issue #1 to issue you are commenting on.

It works for pull requests too, try `Fixed in pull request #2`. GitHub will automatically link any `#` with a number to issue or pull request.
