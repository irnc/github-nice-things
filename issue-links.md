# Two way links between issues and pull requests

Instead of commenting on some issue with `Look at [this issue](https://github.com/irnc/github-nice-things/issues/1)` write just `Look at issue #1.` GitHub would automatically add link to `issue #1` text. And as a bonus point, it would create a back link from issue #1 to issue you are commenting on.

It works for pull requests too, try `Fixed in pull request #2`.
